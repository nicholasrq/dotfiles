## What's included

This is a list of everything that I use daily or somewhat often. Some of the apps on this list run in background or launched on system start.
I've been tailoring my system for years. Now I'm finally at the point where I'm almost 100% satisfied with it.

#### Terminal of choice - Kitty

I'm spending most of the time in the terminal, so this is the most tailored place of them all.

GPU accelerated terminal emulator. I used iTerm2, Alacritty, Wezterm and kitty. The last one turned out to be perfect for. More about kitty.

### UI and system navigation

#### For those who's missing i3 on mac - Aerospace

<img src="./assets/aerospace.gif" alt="aeEospace" width="100%" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 16px;"/>
Aerospace is a tiling window manager for Mac. It is basically a i3 alternative for macOS. While there are little quircks, Aerospace
gets the job done. Vertical and horizontal splits, workspaces, window layouts, you name it. What's even cooler is that you can use key bindings
to perform different actions. In my case, I use it as an app launcher as well.

#### Personalized status bar - Sketchybar
